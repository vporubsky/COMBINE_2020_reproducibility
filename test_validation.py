'''test_validation.py

This file provides unit tests, implemented with pytest for general-purpose
flexibility, to enable the validation stage of the COMBINE_2020_reproducibility_tutorial.
While these routines enable basic functionality for the tutorial, please
consider using the Python biochemical validation and verification package,
SBviper, in your work with Tellurium. Development of SBviper is still underway.'''
